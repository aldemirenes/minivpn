MINIVPN

Proof-of-concept VPN implementation. Made for just learning
purposes and fun.

Usage:
There are two folder in the main directory which is client
and server.
If you want to test the MiniVPN in your local,
you can use Vagrant provisioning
It is sufficient to go to the respective folder and run
'vagrant up' command in the respective folder. After vagrant
machine is started to run, you can connect to vagrant machine
with 'vagrant ssh' command.
You should start server initially. After server is started, you
can connect to server with client.

Server usage:
After connect to the vagrant machine with SSH, go to /vagrant
directory. When you check the files in this folder, you will 
see files which are under the server folder.
In the /vagrant directory, run './dtls_server_init.sh' script.

Client usage:
After connect to the vagrant machine with SSH, go to /vagrant
directory. When you check the files in this folder, you will 
see files which are the same with under the client folder. 
In the /vagrant directory, run './dtls_client_init.sh <server_ip>' script. 

NOTE:
If you are running server or client other machines than vagrant
machines which is configured beforehand, you should change path
of the SSL certificate and key file in the init scripts.
